# Customization

Since Dash generates web pages, we can add CSS to control the style of the dashboard. You can add CSS inline-declarations to Dash by supplying a dictionary with property names and values to the `style` argument of the component. Keys (property names) must be camelCased. So, `text-align` becomes `textAlign`, and `background-color` becomes `backgroundColor`.
