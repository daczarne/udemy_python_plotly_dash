# Dash

Dash is a Python framework built on top of Plotly.js, Flask, and React for building interactive data dashboards and applications.

Every Dash application has two main parts: 

- Layout: determines how the dashboard looks. We can build different layout components with two libraries: `dash_core_components` and `dash_html_components`.

- Interactive features: they define what and how the users can interacte with. They are built with `@callback` functions.
